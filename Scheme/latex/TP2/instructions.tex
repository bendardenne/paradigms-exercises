\section{Functional Programming}

\scheme follows the functional programming paradigm. To put it simply, functional programming is built around the concept of \emph{functions}, viewed as mathematical objects: a function takes some inputs and returns an output, with no other side-effects. Functional programming avoids mutation of data: an argument passed to a function is never modified itself, it's a new object which is returned as the result of applying a function to an argument. In functional programming, a program is viewed as a series of functions applied to input data.

\section{First-class functions}

Like many other functional programming languages, \scheme has first-class functions. This means that functions can be treated like any other entities and the program, and more specifically, a function can be passed as argument to, can be returned from a function and can stored in a variable.

For instance, \scheme has a built-in \schemecode{filter} function. This function takes two arguments: the first is a predicate $p$ and the second is a list $l$. It returns the list $l$, in which all the elements for which $p$ is false have been removed. Consider this example:

\begin{minted}{scheme}
	(define mylist '(1 2 -3 4 5 -6 7 8 -9))
	(filter positive? mylist)
	 
	 > '(1 2 4 5 7 8)
\end{minted}

\schemecode{positive?} is of course a built-in \scheme predicate which returns \schemecode{#t} if its argument is a positive number. 


\begin{instruction}
	In the previous session, you wrote a \schemecode{sum-cubes} function which may have looked like the following: 
	
	\begin{minted}{scheme}
	(define (sum-cubes a b)
	   (if (> a b)
	      0
	      (+ (cube a) (sum-cubes (+ a 1) b))))
	\end{minted}
	
	Rewrite a more generic \schemecode{sum-func} which takes three arguments $f$, $a$ and $b$ and which returns the sum of $f$ applied to all integers in $\{a, a+1, ... b\}$. Uses this function to perform a \schemecode{sum-cubes}, for instance:
	\begin{minted}{scheme}
	(sum-func cube 0 3)
	> 36
	\end{minted}
	
	Finally, define \schemecode{sum-cubes} in terms of this new \schemecode{sum-func}.
\end{instruction}


\subsection{Anonymous functions}

Sometimes it can be useful to write a small function as argument to another directly in the function call, without \schemecode{define}'ing it entirely. This is where \schemecode{lambda}'s become handy. For instance, to use filter with a predicate that filter all items equal to 5:

\begin{minted}{scheme}
(filter (lambda (x) (not (equal? x 5))) mylist)

> '(1 2 -3 4 -6 7 8 -9)
\end{minted}

The  \schemecode{lambda} expression creates an anonymous function which, to $x$ associates the boolean $x != 5$. 

\begin{instruction}
	In the previous session, you defined a \schemecode{how-many} function. A function providing a more generic version of this is actually built into \scheme: \schemecode{count}. Try to implement an equivalent \schemecode{how-many} function using  \schemecode{count} and an anonymous function.
\end{instruction}

\begin{instruction}
	Many functions built into \scheme take a functional parameter. We have already seen \schemecode{filter}, and others are \schemecode{apply, map, foldr}. 
	Try to guess / understand what each does based on the following examples:
	
	\begin{minted}{scheme}
	(define mylist '(1 2 -3 4 5 -6 7 8 -9))
	
	(map (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) mylist)
	(apply + mylist)
	(apply max mylist)
	\end{minted}

\end{instruction}


\subsection{Higher-order functions}

As said above, it is possible for a function to return a function (think for example about what should the \schemecode{lambda} builtin return). 

\begin{instruction}
	Write a function \schemecode{mean} which takes as argument a numeric function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and returns the function: 
	
	$$ f': \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \qquad  x,y  \mapsto  \frac{f(x) + f(y)}{2}$$
	
	
	Use this function with the \schemecode{cube} function to compute the mean between  $4^3$ and $16^3$.
\end{instruction}
