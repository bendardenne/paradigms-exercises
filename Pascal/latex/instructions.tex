\section{Getting started}

Download and install \textsf{FPC}, the \textsf{Free Pascal Compiler}\footnote{ \url{http://www.freepascal.org/download.var}}.\textsf{FPC} is a \textsf{Pascal} standalone command-line compiler. To compile a \textsf{Pascal} source, use: 

\verb|$ fpc sourceCode.pas|

which should generate a \verb|sourceCode.o| object file, as well as a \verb|sourceCode| executable binary.

\subsection{Can't find unit error}

If the compiler complains that it can't find a unit with an error message \verb|Fatal: Can't find unit unitName|, it probably means that your compiler is not configured to find the unit packages properly.

The first solution for this is to avoid using units entirely. You should not need them for these practical sessions.

If you really want to use units: locate the \verb|fpc.cfg| config file (on Linux, try \verb|~/.fpc.cfg|) and check that the path to your units installation is included. Typically, on a Linux system, you should have a line with :

\verb| -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/$fpcversion/units/$fpctarget/*|
